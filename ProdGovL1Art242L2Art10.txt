Article 10
Product governance obligations for distributors
1. Member States shall require investment firms, when deciding the range of financial
instruments issued by themselves or other firms and services they intend to offer or
recommend to clients, to comply, in a way that is appropriate and proportionate, with
the relevant requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 10, taking into account the
nature of the financial instrument, the investment service and the target market for
the product.
Member States shall ensure that investment firms also comply with the requirements
of Directive 2014/65/EU when offering or recommending financial instruments
manufactured by entities that are not subject to Directive 2014/65/EU. As part of this
process, such investment firms shall have in place effective arrangements to ensure
that they obtain sufficient information about these financial instruments from these
manufacturers. 
EN 22 EN
Investment firms shall determine the target market for the respective financial
instrument, even if the target market was not defined by the manufacturer.
2. Member States shall require investment firms to have in place adequate product
governance arrangements to ensure that products and services they intend to offer or
recommend are compatible with the needs, characteristics, and objectives of an
identified target market and that the intended distribution strategy is consistent with
the identified target market. Investment firms shall appropriately identify and assess
the circumstances and needs of the clients they intend to focus on, so as to ensure
that clients interests are not compromised as a result of commercial or funding
pressures. As part of this process, firms shall identify any groups of clients for whose
needs, characteristics and objectives the product or service is not compatible.
Member States shall ensure that investment firms obtain from manufactures that are
subject to Directive 2014/65/EU information to gain the necessary understanding and
knowledge of the products they intend to recommend or sell in order to ensure that
these products will be distributed in accordance with the needs, characteristics and
objectives of the identified target market,
Member States shall require investment firms to take all reasonable steps to ensure
they also obtain adequate and reliable information from manufacturers not subject to
Directive 2014/65/EU to ensure that products will be distributed in accordance with
the characteristics, objectives and needs of the target market. Where relevant
information is not publicly available, the distributor shall take all reasonable steps to
obtain such relevant information from the manufacturer or its agent. Acceptable
publicly available information is information which is clear, reliable and produced to
meet regulatory requirements, such as disclosure requirements under Directive
2003/71/EC or Directive 2004/109/EC. This obligation is relevant for products sold
on primary and secondary markets and shall apply in a proportionate manner,
depending on the degree to which publicly available information is obtainable and
the complexity of the product.
Investment firms shall use the information obtained from manufacturers and
information on their own clients to identify the target market and distribution
strategy. When an investment firm acts both as a manufacturer and a distributor, only
one target market assessment shall be required.
3. Member States shall require investment firms, when deciding the range of financial
instrument and services that they offer or recommend and the respective target
markets, to maintain procedures and measures to ensure compliance with all
applicable requirements under Directive 2014/65/EU including those relating to
disclosure, assessment of suitability or appropriateness, inducements and proper
management of conflicts of interest. In this context, particular care shall be taken
when distributors intend to offer or recommend new products or there are variations
to the services they provide.
4. Member States shall require investment firms to periodically review and update their
product governance arrangements in order to ensure that they remain robust and fit
for their purpose, and take appropriate actions where necessary.
5. Member States shall require investment firms to review the investment products they
offer or recommend and the services they provide on a regular basis, taking into
account any event that could materially affect the potential risk to the identified
target market. Firms shall assess at least whether the product or service remains 
EN 23 EN
consistent with the needs, characteristics and objectives of the identified target
market and whether the intended distribution strategy remains appropriate. Firms
shall reconsider the target market and/or update the product governance
arrangements if they become aware that they have wrongly identified the target
market for a specific product or service or that the product or service no longer meets
the circumstances of the identified target market, such as where the product becomes
illiquid or very volatile due to market changes.
6. Member States shall require investment firms to ensure their compliance function
oversee the development and periodic review of product governance arrangements in
order to detect any risk of failure to comply with the obligations set out in this
Article.
7. Member States shall require investment firms to ensure that relevant staff possess the
necessary expertise to understand the characteristics and risks of the products that
intend to offer or recommend and the services provided as well as the needs,
characteristics and objectives of the identified target market.
8. Member States shall require investment firms to ensure that the management body
has effective control over the firms product governance process to determine the
range of investment products that they offer or recommend and the services provided
to the respective target markets. Investment firms shall ensure that the compliance
reports to the management body systematically include information about the
products they offer or recommend and the services provided. The compliance reports
shall be made available to competent authorities on request.
9. Member States shall ensure distributors provide manufacturers with information on
sales and, where appropriate, information on the above reviews to support product
reviews carried out by manufacturers.
10. Where different firms work together in the distribution of a product or service,
Member States shall ensure the investment firm with the direct client relationship has
ultimate responsibility to meet the product governance obligations set out in this
Article. However, intermediary investment firms shall:
(a) ensure that relevant product information is passed from the manufacturer to the
final distributor in the chain;
(b) if the manufacturer requires information on product sales in order to comply
with their own product governance obligations, enable them to obtain it; and
(c) apply the product governance obligations for manufacturers, as relevant, in
relation to the service they provide.
