Product Governance Requirements
Article 9
Product governance obligations for investment firms manufacturing financial instruments
1. Member States shall require investment firms to comply with this Article when
manufacturing financial instruments, which encompasses the creation, development,
issuance and/or design of financial instruments.
Member States shall require investment firms manufacturing financial instruments to
comply, in a way that is appropriate and proportionate, with the relevant
requirements in paragraphs 2 to 15, taking into account the nature of the financial
instrument, the investment service and the target market for the product.
EN 19 EN
2. Member States shall require investment firms to establish, implement and maintain
procedures and measures to ensure the manufacturing of financial instruments
complies with the requirements on proper management of conflicts of interest,
including remuneration. In particular, investment firms manufacturing financial
instruments shall ensure that the design of the financial instrument, including its
features, does not adversely affect end clients or does not lead to problems with
market integrity by enabling the firm to mitigate and/or dispose of its own risks or
exposure to the underlying assets of the product, where the investment firm already
holds the underlying assets on own account.
3. Member States shall require investment firms to analyse potential conflicts of
interests each time a financial instrument is manufactured. In particular, firms shall
assess whether the financial instrument creates a situation where end clients may be
adversely affected if they take:
(a) an exposure opposite to the one previously held by the firm itself; or
(b) an exposure opposite to the one that the firm wants to hold after the sale of the
product.
4. Member States shall ensure that investment firms consider whether the financial
instrument may represent a threat to the orderly functioning or to the stability of
financial markets before deciding to proceed with the launch of the product.
5. Member States shall require investment firms to ensure that relevant staff involved in
the manufacturing of financial instruments possess the necessary expertise to
understand the characteristics and risks of the financial instruments they intend to
manufacture.
6. Member States shall require investment firms to ensure that the management body
has effective control over the firm’s product governance process. Investment firms
shall ensure that the compliance reports to the management body systematically
include information about the financial instruments manufactured by the firm,
including information on the distribution strategy. Investment firms shall make the
reports available to their competent authority on request.
7. Investment firms shall ensure the compliance function monitors the development and
periodic review of product governance arrangements in order to detect any risk of
failure by the firm to comply with the obligations set out in this Article.
8. Member States shall require investment firms, where they collaborate, including with
entities which are not authorised and supervised in accordance with Directive
2014/65/EU or third-country firms, to create, develop, issue and/or design a product,
to outline their mutual responsibilities in a written agreement.
9. Member States shall require investment firms to identify at a sufficiently granular
level the potential target market for each financial instrument and specify the type(s)
of client for whose needs, characteristics and objectives the financial instrument is
compatible. As part of this process, the firm shall identify any group(s) of clients for
whose needs, characteristics and objectives the financial instrument is not
compatible. Where investment firms collaborate to manufacture a financial
instrument, only one target market needs to be identified.
Investment firms manufacturing financial instruments that are distributed through
other investment firms shall determine the needs and characteristics of clients for
whom the product is compatible based on their theoretical knowledge of and past 
EN 20 EN
experience with the financial instrument or similar financial instruments, the
financial markets and the needs, characteristics and objectives of potential end
clients.
10. Member States shall require investment firms to undertake a scenario analysis of
their financial instruments which shall assess the risks of poor outcomes for end
clients posed by the product and in which circumstances these outcomes may occur.
Investment firms shall assess the financial instrument under negative conditions
covering what would happen if, for example:
(a) the market environment deteriorated;
(b) the manufacturer or a third party involved in manufacturing and or functioning
of the financial instrument experiences financial difficulties or other
counterparty risk materialises;
(c) the financial instrument fails to become commercially viable; or
(d) demand for the financial instrument is much higher than anticipated, putting a
strain on the firm’s resources and/or on the market of the underlying
instrument.
11. Member States shall require investment firms to determine whether a financial
instrument meets the identified needs, characteristics and objectives of the target
market, including by examining the following elements:
(a) the financial instrument’s risk/reward profile is consistent with the target
market; and
(b) financial instrument design is driven by features that benefit the client and not
by a business model that relies on poor client outcomes to be profitable.
12. Member States shall ensure that investment firms consider the charging structure
proposed for the financial instrument, including by examining the following:
(a) financial instrument’s costs and charges are compatible with the needs,
objectives and characteristics of the target market;
(b) charges do not undermine the financial instrument’s return expectations, such
as where the costs or charges equal, exceed or remove almost all the expected
tax advantages linked to a financial instrument; and
(c) the charging structure of the financial instrument is appropriately transparent
for the target market, such as that it does not disguise charges or is too complex
to understand.
13. Member States shall require investment firms to ensure that the provision of
information about a financial instrument to distributors includes information about
the appropriate channels for distribution of the financial instrument, the product
approval process and the target market assessment and is of an adequate standard to
enable distributors to understand and recommend or sell the financial instrument
properly.
14. Member States shall require investment firms to review the financial instruments
they manufacture on a regular basis, taking into account any event that could
materially affect the potential risk to the identified target market. Investment firms
shall consider if the financial instrument remains consistent with the needs,
characteristics and objectives of the target market and if it is being distributed to the 
EN 21 EN
target market, or is reaching clients for whose needs, characteristics and objectives
the financial instrument is not compatible.
15. Member States shall require investment firms to review financial instruments prior to
any further issue or re-launch, if they are aware of any event that could materially
affect the potential risk to investors and at regular intervals to assess whether the
financial instruments function as intended. Investment firms shall determine how
regularly to review their financial instruments based on relevant factors, including
factors linked to the complexity or the innovative nature of the investment strategies
pursued. Firms shall also identify crucial events that would affect the potential risk or
return expectations of the financial instrument, such as:
(a) the crossing of a threshold that will affect the return profile of the financial
instrument; or
(b) the solvency of certain issuers whose securities or guarantees may impact the
performance of the financial instrument.
Member States shall ensure that, when such events occur, investment firms take
appropriate action which may consist of:
(a) the provision of any relevant information on the event and its consequences on
the financial instrument to the clients or the distributors of the financial
instrument if the investment firm does not offer or sell the financial instrument
directly to the clients;
(b) changing the product approval process;
(c) stopping further issuance of the financial instrument;
(d) changing the financial instrument to avoid unfair contract terms;
(e) considering whether the sales channels through which the financial instruments
are sold are appropriate where firms become aware that the financial
instrument is not being sold as envisaged;
(f) contacting the distributor to discuss a modification of the distribution process;
(g) terminating the relationship with the distributor; or
(h) informing the relevant competent authority.
