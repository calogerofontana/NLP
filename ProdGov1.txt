Article 16(3) An investment firm which manufactures financial instruments for sale to clients shall maintain, operate and review a
process for the approval of each financial instrument and significant adaptations of existing financial instruments before it
is marketed or distributed to clients.
The product approval process shall specify an identified target market of end clients within the relevant category of clients
for each financial instrument and shall ensure that all relevant risks to such identified target market are assessed and that
the intended distribution strategy is consistent with the identified target market.
An investment firm shall also regularly review financial instruments it offers or markets, taking into account any event
that could materially affect the potential risk to the identified target market, to assess at least whether the financial
instrument remains consistent with the needs of the identified target market and whether the intended distribution
strategy remains appropriate.An investment firm which manufactures financial instruments shall make available to any distributor all appropriate
information on the financial instrument and the product approval process, including the identified target market of the
financial instrument.
Where an investment firm offers or recommends financial instruments which it does not manufacture, it shall have in
place adequate arrangements to obtain the information referred to in the fifth subparagraph and to understand the
characteristics and identified target market of each financial instrument.
